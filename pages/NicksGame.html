                This is Nick's Ghost Hunting game. This game was created as part of our exam. The goal of the game is to find, identify, and neutralize all ghosts that spawn randomly in the building. If you wait too long, the ghosts will come to you, and you will lose the game.
                We had to create a game inspired by "Observation Duty." We came up with the idea of merging it with FNAF and Phasmophobia. Since we had to use the school as the environment, we decided to record videos and use them in the game. In hindsight, we should have used larger objects, as some are difficult to see. Ultimately, this project turned out very well within the short time frame we were given. Additionally, we had one fewer team member than the other groups. Despite this, it was a great success.

                    Here you can see the traps in action. You notice something has changed on the camera and can identify which ghost it is. You press the button to activate the trap, killing the ghost. You hear a sound effect that lets you know something has happened, the strange occurrences on the cameras disappear, and the screen returns to normal.

                    Here you can see a top-down view of the environment. We had to ensure that the office still gave off a creepy vibe. Overall, this project went very well in terms of communication, and everything came together perfectly. If you are interested, you can play the game below.
