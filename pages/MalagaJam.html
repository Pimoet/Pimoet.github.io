                Willow is a game created for MalagaJam. It is a short 15-minute game with puzzle and platforming elements. The goal of the game is to save the tree in the center of the village by collecting all the "Growth Orbs." Once you have collected all the Growth Orbs, the game ends.
                With school, we had the opportunity to travel to Malaga and participate in the GameJam. Upon arrival at the location, we formed teams. Ultimately, we continued as a team of five. Together, we managed to create a great project within 48 hours.

                   For the game, we aimed for a style similar to Paper Mario, combining 3D with 2D sprites. I personally focused a lot on creating a smooth-feeling movement system for the character in this project. By balancing the system well, players can move smoothly through the world without it becoming frustrating.

                    Additionally, I also paid a lot of attention to the dialogue system. Using an object-oriented dialogue system, it is possible to easily modify the dialogue. This ultimately saved a lot of time because you can quickly and easily make changes without needing adjustments in the code. The object-oriented dialogue system allows me to enable characters to have longer "conversations" without everything breaking or becoming unclear.

                    Although we did not win, I am extremely proud of what we achieved with this project. We did our best to create a functioning game, and my communication and collaboration skills improved as a result. This project was my first significant experience with Object-Oriented Programming, and I immediately loved it. If you're interested, you can play a WebGL build of the game below. It may look a bit less appealing than it originally was, as I had to remove the shaders.
