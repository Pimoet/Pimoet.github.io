                This is a 2D roguelike side-scroller called Rally of the Flame, where the goal is to complete the level using your bow and sword to defeat all enemies.
                This project was developed in groups of five students and was originally intended for the arcade cabinet at our school's open day. I focused primarily on the enemies and the bow-shooting mechanics, which are essential for defeating the enemies. There are a total of three types of enemies: a flying enemy that periodically flies toward the player to deal damage, an enemy that charges at the player when you look at it, and an enemy that can teleport and shoot projectiles at the player.
                I am proud of the work we were able to deliver as a team.

                    This is the final room of the game. At this point, you have purchased one of two upgrades with the gold you collected. You can choose between health regeneration or a dash. If you proceed to the right, you will have completed the game.
                    In this room, you will encounter two enemies. The first enemy, called "cultist," is positioned at the top and shoots projectiles at the player that pass through walls. If the player comes too close for one and a half seconds, the cultist teleports away and continues shooting at the player.
                    The second enemy, called "stalker," has more HP. It will only attack the player when you look directly at it.
