                This project was developed for the Physical Computing course, where we had to create a project with an Arduino that incorporated user input. I chose to create a physical version of the game Pong.
                My idea for this project came from the Videojuego museum in Malaga. In this museum, there were large LED strips where you could play a game. The objective was to reach the end while avoiding enemies by stopping at the right moments.
                While I was redecorating our garden house, I wanted something new to put on the wall. That’s when I came up with this project. The ultimate goal is to mount this game on a large LED strip on the wall.

                    The game has two players, each with their own "paddle" that they activate to bounce the ball back. The ball moves back and forth between the paddles.
                    The software monitors the players' input and adjusts the ball's movement based on the position of the paddles and the direction of the ball. When the ball hits a paddle, it bounces back and the speed increases. The speed of the ball escalates depending on how long the game has been running.
                    The LED strips are used to visualize the playing field and display the positions of the ball and paddles. The color of the LEDs changes based on the position of the ball and paddles.
